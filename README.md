# 🛡️ THE VAULT: Anti-Deepfake Identity System

**The Vault** is a high-security biometric liveness detection system designed to secure high-value Web3 assets against deepfake injection attacks.

## 🚀 Technical Core
- **MFPL (Multi-Factor Proof of Life):** Uses randomized active challenges to verify user intent.
- **Chroma-Flash Audit:** Real-time lighting reflection analysis to detect injection attacks.
- **MediaPipe Face Mesh:** Sub-pixel landmark tracking for micro-tremor detection.
- **Gemini Multimodal AI:** Forensic analysis of facial sentiment and synthetic artifacts.
